********* make a syntax question first!

<!-- Create an image!

For this quiz, I want you to display your first image.

An image is made with an <img> element. It looks like so:

    <img src="http://somewebsite.com/image.jpg" alt="short description">

`src` and `alt` are called attributes. Attributes are used to describe the properties of elements. `src` stands for "source," which can be the URL of any image, and `alt` stands for "alternative description," which is important for people who use screen readers to browse the web.

An image element is a little different than the elements you've seen before. Images do not need closing tags!

Here's a great reference for images: *** mdn/ images

How to Complete this Quiz:
*****

* Create an image element at the designated spot in the paragraph below.
* Set the source to: http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png
* Set the alt description to a quick description of the image (maybe something like, "Udacity logo").
* Play around with the URL! See if you can make a different image appear.

<p>
  This is a big paragraph of text about Udacity. Cool. Cool. And here is an image! <!-- put the image element here! --> Here is more text. Here's another question for you: how is the text reacting to the image? Is the image on its own line or is it showing up in the same last as the rest of the text?

Here's how I made my image element: <img src="http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png" alt="Udacity logo">

Did you notice that the image displayed in the same line as the rest of the text? Images are inline elements, which means that they are perfectly happy appearing in the same line as text. You'll be learning more about inline elements in later lessons.
