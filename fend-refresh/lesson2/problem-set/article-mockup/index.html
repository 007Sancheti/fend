  <h2>My Breakfast</h2>
  <h4>A Love Story</h4>
  <p><em>By Cameron Pittman</em></p>
  <p>8 March 2016</p>
  <p>I love breakfast. It is, by far, the best meal of the day. It wakes me up in the morning. I woke up excited this morning because today is <em>spicy</em> eggs day.</p>
  <p>As soon as I opened my eyes, my feet were taking me into the kitchen. I pull my mini egg pan out of the cupboard and ignited the stovetop. With the pan heating, I pulled a carton of large eggs from the refrigerator and placed two on the countertop.</p>
  <p>My mouth felt dry. I poured myself a glass of water, downed it, and refilled my glass with orange juice. Medium pulp.</p>
  <p>Eggs by themselves are delicious, but they're most valuable as a carrier for other flavors. I love spicy food and hot sauces. My collection has grown large because I go out of my way to find hot sauces and friends and family tend to give me hot sauces as gifts.</p>
  <p>Long story short, I:
  <ul>
    <li>found a hot sauce.</li>
    <li>cooked up the eggs over easy drenched in hot sauce.</li>
    <li>toasted an english muffin.</li>
    <li>dropped the eggs onto the muffin and made a sandwich.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I let the delicious yolk ooze out and scarfed it down in about three bites.</p>
  <p>Today is a good day :)</p>
