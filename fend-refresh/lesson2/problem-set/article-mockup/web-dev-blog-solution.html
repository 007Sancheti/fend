  <p>There is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we experience … the web. If you proceed from the notion that every person who engages with the web would prefer a great experience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the web would prefer that a Web Developer have done a great job. Companies of course know this, so they hire Web Developers to ensure their sites provide great experiences. So, lots of websites and lots of users means lots of demand. LOTS of demand.</p>
  <h2>Job Growth</h2>
  <p>A recent post from The Creative Group sums up the importance of Web Developers quite nicely:</p>
  <p><em>These masters of the web don’t just write code; they make the digital magic happen. They’re responsible for what you experience every time you open a browser, app or online game—from content to presentation to behavior layers.</em></p>
  <p><em>So it comes as no surprise that these professionals made our list of hot jobs for 2016.</em></p>
  <p>Of course, that’s just one opinion. But it’s one supported by some pretty impressive statistics. As but one example, consider that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 27% growth in available Web Developer jobs in the next eight years! That’s a tremendous amount of growth, to say the least.</p>
  <h2>Salary Growth</h2>
  <p>Part of what is both most daunting—and most appealing—about pursuing a job as a Web Developer is the training and experience required, and the pace of change in the field. As a recent MSN Money article noted, “Since the world of web development changes as rapidly as the internet does, these experts are constantly learning and training.” In a nutshell, this is why we offer our <strong>Front-End Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Senior Front-End Web Developer</strong> Nanodegree programs. Because we believe that to secure rewarding employment in this exponentially growing—but also very competitive—field, you need to equip yourself with the most in-demand skills, as determined by the most innovative companies. And by the way, that MSN article? It was a Top 10 list of highest-paying jobs for vocational grads!</p>
